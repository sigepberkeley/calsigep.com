<p>SigEp is a fraternity committed to brotherly love and personal excellence. SigEps do not haze and there is no pledging process. Instead of breaking down new members to fit a mold, SigEp uses each brother's strengths as a foundation for four-years of continuous development.</p><p><b>The Balanced Man Program</b> provides a framework for brothers to grow throughout their time at Cal. SigEps leave college with lifelong friendships, unforgettable experiences and a foundation for future success.</p>

<p> Mind and body do not exist separately from one another. Studies show exercise improves intelligence and positive thinking boosts athletic performance.</p><p>SigEps take their physical fitness seriously, recognizing its importance in living life to the fullest. SigEps run marathons and half-marathons, lift weights, practice good nutrition, and compete in triathlon, soccer, and other sports.</p><p> Each spring, SigEps bike ride from San Francisco to Los Angeles, on a trip called Pedal For Life, in order to raise funds for the Histio Cure Foundation. By pushing one another to scale new heights in their personal development, SigEps achieve more together than they could alone.</p>
